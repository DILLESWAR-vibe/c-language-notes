## ðŸ“˜ 1. Introduction to C

- C is a **procedural programming language** developed by **Dennis Ritchie** in **1972** at Bell Labs.  
- It is widely used for **system programming**, **embedded systems**, and **software development**.  
- C is known as the **mother of all modern languages** (like C++, Java, and Python).  
- Programs in C are compiled and executed for high performance.

### ðŸ”¹ Structure of a C Program
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
